    "White dwarf 'stars' are the remnants of a standard star (0.5 to 8 times the size of our own sun). These constitute the majoraty of the stars in the universe. For most of it's life, a star like this fuses hydrogen into helium emmiting light as a result. As the star uses up its hydrogen the energy from the fusionin the star becomes weaker. This energy is what resists the star collapsing due to its own gravity. As the energy dwindles, the star shrinks which causes the temperatures in the core of the star to increase. Gradually it will beome hot enough in the core of the sun to fuse helium. Helium starts to fuse and increases the fusion pressure of the star causing the star to expand greatly. The star then enters its red giant phase of its life. Helium is fused into carbon and oxygen, but average stars can never get hot enough to fuse carbon. \n",
    "As the helium is used up the star contracts again. however as it contracts, left over helium and hydrogen re-ignite with the increase in heat. This flings the layers outward expanding the star and cooling the center temperature. Fusion stopss and the star collapses again. Tis is the star's final stage in life where the size of the star oscelates with the outer layers bouncing off the center core. The oscilations get larger and larger as the layers of the star bounce off of eachother. This process continues untill the star flings its outer layers so far out that they do not gravatationally condense again. This leaves the superhot superdense core of carbon(and a bit of oxygen) which could not be fused. \n",
    "This core is called a white dwarf star (it is called this because it glows a bright white because of residual heat but it is not fusing to create more energy hense it is a 'dwarf star.') The white dwarf radiates its heat away gradually. While it is hot the white dwarf contains enough energy to keep its atoms as an ionized superdense plazma; However, as the energy radiates away the structure crystalizes. The properties of this crystal structure are unknown, but the composition has been likened to diamond (this is not entirely accurate as it is much denser and it contains a significant proportion of oxygen however it is an apt comparason as it demonstrates the possible usefulness of the resultant material)."
