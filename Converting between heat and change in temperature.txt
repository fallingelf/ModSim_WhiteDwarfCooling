standard: q = m c deltaT
problems: assumes a specific heat independient of temperature. due to the strange nature of white dwarfs and the temperatures involved this is unuseable.
einstein solids. this models a solid as an object where the internal energy is described by the sumation of each particle serving as a 3D quantum harmonic oscillator
this simplifies to 
U internal energy (J) = Number of oscillators (particles)*k* T
heat Q = deltaU
=> Q = N*K*deltaT

temperature to energy:
u = NKT
energy to temperature
deltaU/(NK) = T
